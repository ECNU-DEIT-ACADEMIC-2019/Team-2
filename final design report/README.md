####  （1）Location technology
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The location technology is mainly embodied in the app's ability to detect the user's location in real time and automatically provide corresponding scenes for the user based on the location. If the user has needs or interests, the user can learn the scene. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an informal oral English learning APP, the general learning process is that learners find appropriate learning resources according to their own needs and use learning resources for learning. If the resources cannot meet their needs, learners will find more appropriate resources again. However, a very important issue is how learners think about what kind of resources they need. In many cases, learners will not be aware of what they could have learned. Special reminders will weaken the function of technical services and enhance the visibility, making learners pay more attention to peripheral learning tools or environmental factors instead of learning content.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the introduction of positioning technology, learners can focus on the task of oral learning more smoothly and naturally without additional cognitive burden. Therefore, this APP combines the ubiquitous learning theory, and makes use of location technology, blending oral English learning in learners' daily life, and even its current environment. This makes the oral English learning and learners encounter problems or the real scene a combination, enables learners to study at any time, any place, and better reflect the self-orientation of learning.

####  （2）Speech recognition technology
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speech recognition technology is mainly embodied in the APP's ability to detect and recognize users' pronunciation of English words, sentence reading and dialogue information, and score and give feedback based on their pronunciation. At present, Baidu speech technology, JD speech recognition technology, iflytek speech recognition technology and other speech recognition technology have been developing rapidly, and their accuracy and timeliness have reached a good level.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an oral practice APP, user's pronunciation recognition is a very important function. Through speech recognition technology, users can transfer their pronunciation audio files to the database, which will automatically analyze and compare, point out the defects of their accents, and correct them in time. Speech recognition technology allows learners to learn anywhere, anytime, without relying on teachers or partners.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through this technology, learners can choose to interact with the machine, and the system will automatically recognize its pronunciation and give feedback, saving human and material resources. And this automatic grading system can help students who are afraid to open their mouths in front of other people to practice. At the same time, the APP has added the real person matching dialogue mode of specific scenes, and the high accuracy, high speed recognition and the speech recognition technology that supports customized optimization can satisfy the demand for timely feedback.

####  （3）Deep learning technology
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deep learning technology is mainly embodied in the ability to predict where you might want to go, and deep learning technology can also be used to generate the human-computer conversation.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the deep learning technology, the evaluation process of oral English APP was generally to randomly select speech samples from the predetermined speech training library and follow them according to the standard pronunciation of the samples. After the emergence of deep learning technology, in the process of learners' pronunciation, the system can extract the information of learners with high scores and the standard characteristic information for comparison, so as to constantly modify and improve.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an English-speaking practice APP, the platform needs to record learners' preferences and habits, automatically predict and recommend the possible learning scenarios in the next stage according to learners' psychological hobbies and behavioral habits, and provide them with seasonal or phased services, as well as recommendation services for interested content.

####  （4）Big data technology
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Big data technology is mainly embodied in three aspects: first, it records the most frequently visited places by learners through big data technology, and recommends them according to the times and dates of visits. Second, according to the rank of the learner, the system can customize it to match the real person. Third, in the scene dialogue, if there are words or sentences in the collection of the incorrect words, it will be provided to be remembered again.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the development of Internet, learners' behaviors on the network platform can be recorded. This kind of big data can help us better understand human behavior and psychology and better understand objective laws after certain analysis. For example, learners' learning time, learning content and learning path on the Internet can be taken as data to identify learners' learning style and learning status.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through big data analysis, the APP can record learners' learning records and scene search, and develop personalized learner service experience that meets learners' actual needs. At the same time, the personalized recommendation based on big data technology can select the content suitable for learners' English level, push the key and difficult knowledge, and match the characters of the same level according to their English level for game dialogue, making oral English learning more accurate and meaningful.

####  （5）Mobile development technology
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the app also uses other mobile development technologies, such as communication technology, algorithms which all contribute to the normal operation of the application.

### 9.1 The questionnaire 
### 9.2 Confidence_Intervals Sheet
### 9.3 Answer_Distributions Sheet
### 9.4 Inconsistencies
### 9.5 Sample_size
### 9.6 Scale_Consistency
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judgment criteria: there is no unified standard to determine how big the value of the reliability coefficient should be. However, it is generally believed that if the reliability coefficient is above 0.9, the reliability is very well. The reliability coefficient is acceptable at 0.8-0.9. At 0.7-0.8, the scale does not lose its value. But if the coefficient below 0.7 indicates a change. In this analysis, the scale was judged to have reliability based on the alpha value greater than 0.7.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alpha coefficient and Guttmans Lambda2 coefficient can both be used to measure the reliability of the scale, and there is little difference in this analysis. In the six dimensions, the two coefficients above 0.9 of attractiveness, stimulation and novelty indicate that the attractiveness stimulation and novelty scale has a high reliability. the perspicuity alpha and Guttmans Lambda2 value are both 0.87, which indicates that the reliability of problems in perspicuity dimension is acceptable. The alpha and lambda2 values of efficiency and dependability are all above 0.7, which proves that the scale of efficiency and dependability does not lose its value. Therefore, Therefore, the whole scale has a certain credibility.
### 9.7 Benchmark
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the chart, we can see data from 18,483 people studied in 401 studies concerning different products (business software, web pages, online stores, social networks). It can be used as a benchmark and compared with the questionnaire data, and then the grade of qushuojingying relative to other products can be obtained.
  <div align="center"><img src="https://github.com/ECNU-DEIT-ACADEMIC-2019/Team2/blob/master/images/wu3.JPG" height="240" width="903" > </div> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As can be seen from the mean line of the reference graph that the mean value of the six dimensions of qushuojingying application are all above 1.4, which is above the middle level. Attractiveness (mean=1.84), stimulation (mean=1.76) and novelty (mean=1.73) are all rated as excellent level. Efficiency (mean=1.73) and dependability (mean=1.63) are in good level. And the perspicuity (mean=1.43) is the above average level. In this way, it can be seen that the performance of qushuojingying application in Attractiveness, stimulation and novelty are recognized with customers. The performance of efficiency and dependability is good. But perspicuity in the qushuojingying applacation needs to be improved.
