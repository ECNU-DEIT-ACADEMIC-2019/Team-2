### 9.6 Scale_Consistency
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judgment criteria: there is no unified standard to determine how big the value of the reliability coefficient should be. However, it is generally believed that if the reliability coefficient is above 0.9, the reliability is very well. The reliability coefficient is acceptable at 0.8-0.9. At 0.7-0.8, the scale does not lose its value. But if the coefficient below 0.7 indicates a change. In this analysis, the scale was judged to have reliability based on the alpha value greater than 0.7.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alpha coefficient and Guttmans Lambda2 coefficient can both be used to measure the reliability of the scale, and there is little difference in this analysis. In the six dimensions, the two coefficients above 0.9 of attractiveness, stimulation and novelty indicate that the attractiveness stimulation and novelty scale has a high reliability. the perspicuity alpha and Guttmans Lambda2 value are both 0.87, which indicates that the reliability of problems in perspicuity dimension is acceptable. The alpha and lambda2 values of efficiency and dependability are all above 0.7, which proves that the scale of efficiency and dependability does not lose its value. Therefore, Therefore, the whole scale has a certain credibility.
### 9.7 Benchmark
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the chart, we can see data from 18,483 people studied in 401 studies concerning different products (business software, web pages, online stores, social networks). It can be used as a benchmark and compared with the questionnaire data, and then the grade of qushuojingying relative to other products can be obtained.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As can be seen from the mean line of the reference graph that the mean value of the six dimensions of qushuojingying application are all above 1.4, which is above the middle level. Attractiveness (mean=1.84), stimulation (mean=1.76) and novelty (mean=1.73) are all rated as excellent level. Efficiency (mean=1.73) and dependability (mean=1.63) are in good level. And the perspicuity (mean=1.43) is the above average level. In this way, it can be seen that the performance of qushuojingying application in Attractiveness, stimulation and novelty are recognized with customers. The performance of efficiency and dependability is good. But perspicuity in the qushuojingying applacation needs to be improved.
